# EasyBudget

EasyBudget is a work in progress project for a **simple** budget management Android application.

I got the idea of this app by trying to find one really easy to use budget management app on my phone, the conclusion was simple: there is no app easy enough for me.

### Project idea

I want a simpler app to manage budget on Android. Only 1 account, no export-import features, no stats/graph, simple interface, quick and efficient.

Here's a first look at what it __may__ looks like:

### Technical details

EasyBudget is a simple Android app build with Android Studio that will support Android 4+. 

I'll try to make the app adopt Material design as much as possible using appcompat and some imagination/magic.

The project is made possible by some external libraries made by awesome guys that I want to thanks here:
